# Neural Network Building Blocks: A Hands-On Introduction 

Welcome! This repository contains the course materials for the introductory lecture on the fundamental components of neural networks. The course is designed for beginners and uses a hands-on approach with a single, comprehensive Google Colab notebook. We build everything from scratch using only Python, NumPy, and Matplotlib.

## Overview

The central part of this course is a single, end-to-end project: **building and training a neuron to classify two species of Iris flowers** based on their petal dimensions. This project ties all the theoretical concepts together in a practical application, showing how each building block fits into a complete machine learning workflow.

## What You'll Learn

By completing the notebook in this repository, you will understand and implement the following core concepts from scratch:

-   **Supervised Learning:** The goal of learning from labeled data.
-   **The Perceptron:** The structure of a single neuron, including weights and a bias.
-   **Activation Functions:** The role of functions like **Sigmoid** in neural networks.
-   **Loss Functions:** How functions like **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** are used to measure a model's performance.
-   **Decision Boundaries:** How to visualize what a model has learned.
