# Neural Networks Building Blocks Workshop

Welcome to the **Neural Networks Building Blocks** workshop! This is a comprehensive 90-minute training designed for trainers who want to understand and teach the fundamental concepts of neural networks.

## Workshop Overview

This workshop covers the essential building blocks of neural networks:

1. **General Overview of Supervised Learning** (~20 minutes)
   - Introduction to machine learning paradigms
   - Supervised learning concepts and applications
   - Problem types: classification and regression

2. **The First Perceptron** (~20 minutes)
   - Historical context and motivation
   - Mathematical foundation of the perceptron
   - Implementation and visualization

3. **Activation Functions** (~20 minutes)
   - Role of activation functions in neural networks
   - Common activation functions (sigmoid, ReLU, tanh)
   - Impact on learning and performance

4. **Loss Functions** (~20 minutes)
   - Understanding loss functions
   - Common loss functions for different problems
   - Optimization and gradient descent basics

5. **Hands-on Exercises** (~10 minutes)
   - Practical implementation exercises
   - Interactive examples with real data

## Technical Setup

This workshop is designed to run on **Google Colab**, making it accessible without any local installation requirements. Each notebook can be opened directly in Colab with a single click.

### For Participants:
- A Google account for accessing Colab
- Basic familiarity with Python (helpful but not required)
- No prior machine learning experience needed

### For Trainers:
- Review all notebooks beforehand
- Ensure stable internet connection for Colab
- Have backup materials ready
- Consider running through exercises yourself first

## Getting Started

Each section is available as an interactive Jupyter notebook that can be run in Google Colab. Click the Colab badge at the top of each chapter to launch the notebook directly.
